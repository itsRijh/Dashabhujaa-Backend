Mongoose Schema Definitions:
The code defines three Mongoose schemas: user, products, and services.
Each schema represents a collection in MongoDB and specifies the structure of documents within that collection.
User Schema:
The user schema includes fields such as NAME, EMAIL, PASSWORD, PROFILE_PIC, and more.
It also has arrays for SERVICE_INTEREST and PRODUCT_INTEREST, which contain objects with additional details.
The schema defines various data types (e.g., String, Number) and validation rules (e.g., required, unique).
Products Schema:
The products schema represents product-related information.
It includes fields like PRODUCT_ID, CITY, STATE, TITLE, POSTED_BY, and others.
The schema also uses the fuzzySearch plugin for searching by TITLE and CATEGORY.
Services Schema:
The services schema is similar to the products schema but focuses on services.
It includes fields like SERVICE_ID, TITLE, CITY, STATE, and others.
Like the products schema, it also uses the fuzzySearch plugin.
Other Schemas:
The code snippet also defines schemas for askDesk (question-answer data) and otp (one-time passwords).
Fuzzy Searching:
The fuzzySearch plugin enables fuzzy searching in documents based on specified fields (e.g., TITLE, CATEGORY).
It creates n-grams for the selected keys, allowing for approximate matches in search queries.
Exporting Models:
The module.exports statements export the defined models (e.g., User, products, services) for use in other parts of the application.
